            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Established in 1964, the Center for the Education of Women+ was a pioneering university women’s center. Originally designed to serve the needs of women students and women returning to school or work, CEW+ (then known as the Center for the Continuing Education of Women) was founded with a three-part mission of service, advocacy, and research. The Center for the Education of Women+ (now known as CEW+) continues its work today, serving all University students, staff and faculty, community members, and people of any gender, facing education, employment, or other life issues.</p>

            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>CEW+ provides immediate and ongoing services and the financial support needed to ensure educational success and degree completion. Women+ and underserved students are CEW+’s primary constituency, but all individuals are welcome. CEW+ also serves those who encounter education and career obstacles based on their non-linear paths to, and experiences within, the University community.</p>
            <p>We proudly support students, faculty, staff, and the surrounding community with:</p>

            <h2>Diversity, Equity & Inclusion</h2>
            <p>Since 1964, CEW+ has worked to remove obstacles that impact women and other marginalized groups at U-M. CEW+ has also served as a bridge for returning students and community college transfers and fought for family-friendly policies that have benefited both men and women. Our understanding of the challenges faced by underserved students and underrepresented faculty and staff allows us to contribute greatly to diversity at U-M by providing supports and resources that are responsive to the emerging needs of these groups.</p>
