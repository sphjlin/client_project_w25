## Overview

The *Student Success Portal* is a website I built from scratch using **HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript**. It was a class project, but I treated it like a real client job. The goal was to create a resource hub for UMSI graduate students with a modern look, easy navigation, and strong accessibility support.

The site includes pages for academic advising, counseling (CAPS), CEW+ resources, and a custom 404 error page.
